# TwitchHLS

A small program to view Twitch Streams via HLS, with changeable quality. It uses the default Browser (Safari & Microsoft Edge only) of the System and works only when the browser supports HLS.

The streamer you watch will be saved in the TwitchHLS.config file in the documents folder. 
If you want to change the list of streamers manually you simply open this file and edit it.
